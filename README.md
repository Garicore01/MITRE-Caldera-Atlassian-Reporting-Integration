# Advanced Cybersecurity Laboratory with Atomic Red Team

Welcome to the **Advanced Cybersecurity Laboratory Project** repository. This project is part of my Final Degree Project titled _"Development of an Advanced Cybersecurity Laboratory Using Atomic Red Team"_.

This initiative aims to provide a comprehensive platform for testing, analyzing, and defending against simulated cyber-attacks using the powerful capabilities of Atomic Red Team. The project integrates threat simulations, alerting mechanisms, and detection strategies tailored for security operations centers (SOC).

---

## üöÄ Project Objectives

- **Threat Simulation:** Utilize Atomic Red Team to simulate a wide range of cyber-attacks based on real-world adversary tactics.
- **Detection Engineering:** Create detection rules and scenarios using YARA, SIEM use cases, and OpenEDR responses.
- **Alert Generation:** Configure alerts in security tools like Wazuh to trigger upon detection of simulated threats.
- **Educational Resource:** Provide a structured framework for cybersecurity professionals to practice and improve their skills.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Atomic Red Team:** For executing controlled and realistic attack scenarios.
- **Wazuh:** To configure and trigger alerts based on detection use cases.
- **OpenEDR:** For response mechanisms to simulated security incidents.
- **YARA Rules:** For creating custom threat detection rules.
- **SIEM Integration:** Configuration and testing of use cases within QRadar.
